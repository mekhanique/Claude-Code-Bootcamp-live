# Constrained Refactor — Module 08

Refactor the module for readability only.

## Hard Constraints

- No new files. No new dependencies.
- Public function signatures unchanged. Module-level imports unchanged.
- Behavior on all existing tests must be byte-identical.
- Replace nested conditionals with early returns where it shortens code.
- Rename local variables only when the new name is materially clearer.
- No comments unless they explain a non-obvious *why*.

## Output

A unified diff. No prose around it.
